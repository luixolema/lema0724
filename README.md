Considerations:
 * The checkout date will be considered as the first (inclusive) day in the rental agreement, therefore the checkout date is counted as 1 day.
   - example: checoutDate = 7/29/2024, rentalDayCount = 1, dueDate= 7/29/2024  (same date)
   - example: checoutDate = 7/29/2024, rentalDayCount = 2, dueDate= 7/30/2024  (2 days 2 dates checked: 7/29/2024, 7/30/2024)
